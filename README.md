Setting up the project

1. Check out the repository to a directory on your web server
2. Create a MySQL database called movies_portal
3. Restore movies_portal.sql to the database
4. Copy or rename auth_example.php to auth.php
5. Edit auth.php and add required authentication details
6. Access the page by browsing to the url where you installed it
7. I have made a version of this avaliable at http://dev-sd.creativemeadow.co.za/ for you to look at


Rationale

I decided to use PHP as I am more comfortable with it. 
I decided not to use any php frameworks (e.g. Laravel) to try and keep it lean.
For the fronend I used SCSS, Bootstrap, JQuery
